            <p>About the project</p>
            <p>We decided to simplify our original smart watch concept, instead having a device that assists you while running.<br><br>
                The device would tell you how long you were running (possibly in minutes or seconds.) and how many steps you took.<br><br>
                To put it in simpler terms, when you pressed the left button the micro:bits would begin counting your steps and how long you’ve been running for, once you’re done you would press the right button and the microbit on your wrist would tell you how many steps you took over what time.
